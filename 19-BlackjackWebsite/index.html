    <article class="content">
      <p>
        Hello everyone! In this blog post, I will teach you
        <strong>everything</strong> you need to know about the popular card game
        Blackjack.
      </p>

      <h3>Origins</h3>
      <p>
        The origins of Blackjack is still under debate, but researchers agree
        that Blackjack probably originated in the French casinos around 1700.
        The French cards were called <em>"Vingt-et-Un"</em>, which translates to
        "Twenty-one." These cards are probably derived from card games Chemin de
        Fer, which were popular at that time. The card game was played at the
        French Royal Court during the reign of King Louis XV.
      </p>

      <h3>The Rules</h3>
      <p>
        The goal of Blackjack is to have a hand that totals higher than the
        dealer, but doesn't total to higher than 21. If your hand totals higher
        than 21, it is called a "bust", which means you are out of the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game starts with everyone besides the dealer placing a bet. Then,
        the dealer deals 1 card face up to each player and 1 card face up to
        themselves. Everyone is dealt one more face-up card besides the dealer,
        whose second card is dealt face down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cards 2 through 10 are scored using their face value, and Jacks, Queens,
        and Kings are all equal to 10. Aces can be either 1 or 11, and you can
        choose their value throughout the round if you have one.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your two face-up cards total 21, you automatically win one and a half
        times your bet from the dealer, and you're done for that round.
        Otherwise, the dealer asks whether you want another card from the top of
        the deck. If you do, say "hit" or motion towards yourself with your
        hand. There's no limit to how many cards you can ask for, but once your
        hand totals higher than 21, you bust and the dealer gets your bet. If
        you don't want any more cards, say "stay" or wave your hand over the
        table.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the dealer has gone around the table, they flip up their face-down
        card. If it's 16 or under, they have to take another card. If it's 17 or
        higher, they have to stay with their hand. If the dealer busts, every
        player that's still in that round wins twice their bet. However, if the
        dealer doesn't bust, only the players whose hands are higher than the
        dealer's win twice their bet. Everyone else loses their initial bet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the round is over, all of the players place a new bet, and another
        round begins.
      </p>

      <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
      <ul class="fun-facts">
        <li>
          The longest game of Blackjack lasted over 50 hours. According to the
          Guinness World Records, Stephen De Raffaele dealt cards for over two
          days between 24-27 August 2001 at the Oracle Casino, Qawra, Malta.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your chances of getting a natural blackjack are just
          <strong>4.8%</strong>. That is equivalent to about 1 in 21 blackjack
          hands!
        </li>
        <li>
          Counting cards is legal. For the unacquainted, card counting refers to
          a strategy in Blackjack where a player keeps a mental tally of the
          cards played in order to calculate the probability of certain cards
          being dealt and therefore obtain an advantage.
        </li>
        <li>
          16 is said to be the worst hand in Blackjack. That's because players
          are usually afraid to "hit" as they might exceed 21 and bust. On the
          other hand, if they choose to stay with their 16, it's typically not
          enough to beat the dealer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Statistically, the dealer will bust almost a third of all hands, or
          29.1%, to be exact. However, one can argue that dealers have a certain
          edge over you because you have to beat them, but they have no
          obligation to beat you.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to Play My Implementation of Blackjack</h3>
      <ol class=rules>
        <li>Press the start button (right) to start a new round. Your cards will be shown inside the second black box, next to the image of Mario. There will also be a number on the right side of your box to indicate the current value of your hand.</li>
        <li>The dealer's first Ace must count as 11, unless doing so would cause the dealer to bust. A player's ace initially counts as 1 but can be converted into an 11 when the player stands if it is possible to do so without busting. Keep this in mind before deciding to hit or stand.</li>
        <li>To add a card to your hand, press the hit button (left).</li>
        <li>To stand, press the stand button (middle).</li>
        <li>If the value of the dealer's hand is below 17, the dealer must continue taking cards until the value is 17 or higher.</li>
      </ol>
