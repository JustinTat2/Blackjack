# Blackjack
Website about Blackjack. Currently a work in progress. Will have interactive JS up soon. Adding Flexbox/CSS Grid soon.

Update 1 on July 10th - just added Flexbox and CSSGrid and JavaScript demo. JS is a little buggy and I will get it sorted out soon.

Update 2 on July 11th - Fixed JS bugs and did some refactoring to improve code readability.

Update 3 on July 11th - Did some more refectoring. Will probably improve HTML and CSS and layout design.

Ideas: Adding a 5-card Charlie rule. Also introducing other suits to more realistically simulate a Blackjack game.
