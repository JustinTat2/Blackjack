        <p>
          Hello everyone! In this blog post, I will teach you <strong>everything</strong> you
          need to know about the popular card game Blackjack.
        </p>

        <h3>Origins</h3>
        <p>
          The origins of Blackjack is still under debate, but researchers agree
          that Blackjack probably originated in the French casinos around 1700.
          The French cards were called <em>"Vingt-et-Un"</em>, which translates to
          "Twenty-one." These cards are probably derived from card games Chemin
          de Fer, which were popular at that time. The card game was played at
          the French Royal Court during the reign of King Louis XV.
        </p>

        <h3>The Rules</h3>
        <p>
          The goal of Blackjack is to have a hand that totals higher than the
          dealer, but doesn't total to higher than 21. If your hand totals
          higher than 21, it is called a "bust", which means you are out of the
          game.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game starts with everyone besides the dealer placing a bet. Then,
          the dealer deals 1 card face up to each player and 1 card face up to
          themselves. Everyone is dealt one more face-up card besides the
          dealer, whose second card is dealt face down.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cards 2 through 10 are scored using their face value, and Jacks,
          Queens, and Kings are all equal to 10. Aces can be either 1 or 11, and
          you can choose their value throughout the round if you have one.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your two face-up cards total 21, you automatically win one and a
          half times your bet from the dealer, and you're done for that round.
          Otherwise, the dealer asks whether you want another card from the top
          of the deck. If you do, say "hit" or motion towards yourself with your
          hand. There's no limit to how many cards you can ask for, but once
          your hand totals higher than 21, you bust and the dealer gets your
          bet. If you don't want any more cards, say "stay" or wave your hand
          over the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the dealer has gone around the table, they flip up their
          face-down card. If it's 16 or under, they have to take another card.
          If it's 17 or higher, they have to stay with their hand. If the dealer
          busts, every player that's still in that round wins twice their bet.
          However, if the dealer doesn't bust, only the players whose hands are
          higher than the dealer's win twice their bet. Everyone else loses
          their initial bet.
        </p>
        <p>Once the round is over, all of the players place a new bet, and another round begins.</p>

        <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
        <ul class="fun-facts">
          <li>The longest game of Blackjack lasted over 50 hours. According to the Guinness World Records, Stephen De Raffaele dealt cards for over two days between 24-27 August 2001 at the Oracle Casino, Qawra, Malta.</li>
          <li>Your chances of getting a natural blackjack are just <strong>4.8%</strong>. That is equivalent to about 1 in 21 blackjack hands!</li>
          <li>Counting cards is legal. For the unacquainted, card counting refers to a strategy in Blackjack where a player keeps a mental tally of the cards played in order to calculate the probability of certain cards being dealt and therefore obtain an advantage.</li>
          <li>16 is said to be the worst hand in Blackjack. That's because players are usually afraid to "hit" as they might exceed 21 and bust. On the other hand, if they choose to stay with their 16, it's typically not enough to beat the dealer.</li>
          <li>Statistically, the dealer will bust almost a third of all hands, or 29.1%, to be exact. However, one can argue that dealers have a certain edge over you because you have to beat them, but they have no obligation to beat you.</li>
        </ul>
